# oto-generator
Things both versions can do
- generate aliases arpasing-style from index.csv
- add suffixes
- user settable oto base values
- optional start/end aliases
- find+replace aliases after generation from replace.csv
- number or delete duplicate aliases

Things the python3 version can do
- has an ugly tkinter gui
- has all strings at beginning, for translators
- has an esperanto translation, just because

Things this will do
- have a nicer Swing gui
- work as a standalone application on all computers
- different oto base values based on phonemes (user settable)

Things this won't do
- fancy audio analysis timing adjustment

I included CSVs for generating a basic Japanese CVVC oto.
